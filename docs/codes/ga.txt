1. Define K (population size), I (number of generations), M (mutation probability) a F (fitness function).
2. Generate K random individuals (first generation).
3. Apply F to all individuals in first generation.
4. Repeat from 1 to I:
  4.1. Repeat from 1 to K:
    4.1.1. Select two random parents x1, x2 from current generation.
           Higher fitness means higher probability of selection.
    4.1.2. Cross these parents, child is created.
    4.1.3. With probability M, mutate this child.
    4.1.4. Apply F to this child.
  4.2. Set all children as population of next generation.
